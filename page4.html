The Seele Schneiders function as accumulators, gathering the necessary amount of spirit particles to create the explosion. The liquid (distilled energy) inside a silver tube acts as the trigger. The preparations for the technique combined with the charging time for the Seele Schneiders make its use in battle impractical unless the user has a partner that can stall to buy time.

By using this technique, the user can control their body as one would a puppet, allowing them to move freely despite paralysis, broken limbs, or any other force that would impede normal movement. It was originally created to allow elderly Quincy to fight effectively. Even if you have a missing body part, you can use this skill and it substitute for that, or neglect a skill that does not allow you to play or use skills in your turn(if this one is used this skill effect stops). 3cp. 35xp<br>9)Holy Slave (Sklaverei)(trap)-Uses the most basic ability to gather Reishi in the most powerful way, by enslaving it. It can literally tear away the components that make up spiritual based objects such as those that make up Hueco Mundo and Soul Society as well as the bodies of spiritual beings. When the body of a spiritual being is affected by this power Kirge can literally assume the characteristics and associated capabilities of his victim. When your target uses a cp based atk skill , neglect the skill and copy the persons body and gain their skills used or unused(this skills will not be shown to user but when user wants to use an opponent skill he has to say the name of the skill and if target doesn’t have it the turn will be wasted).

The only way to restore the lost power is to be hit exactly 19mm to the right of the heart with a spirit arrow. A pentacle-shaped scar will form, and the powers will be restored. After using an attack, While you have a quincy sanrei glove on, sacrifice this glove and you powers to add 10dmg to an ranged attack, this cant be neglected and will remove the target from any mode they are in, but you will not be able to gain cp or use cp skills again, this skill affect you not only in battle but in the real game where you will have to use xp to buy a new glove and get your powers back.

By generating a number of roman numeral-inscribed constructs from the fingers of an outstretched hand, several towering columns of Reishi, shaped like the Quincy Cross, erupt upwards in a circular formation around the practitioner. Anyone who steps foot within the confines of this area will be immediately rent asunder where they stand by the "light of God". While this skill is up any physical attack except ranged attacks that is used on you are neglected and the user of that attack loses 4hp, after 2 of your turns that this skill is up ,opponent must attack you with a punch if he doesn’t have he will be borrowed, opponent cant play on that turn again,and this skill is then removed. 3cp. 50xp
